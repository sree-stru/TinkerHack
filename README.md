Project Description
Digital Health and Technology
The Problem statement
Managing and accessing personal medical histories, lab test results, and insurance information in a timely and organized manner is a significant challenge in healthcare, particularly during emergencies. Patients often lack easily accessible records, and healthcare providers may struggle with incomplete or fragmented data, delaying treatment. Furthermore, the process of claiming health insurance is often tedious and prone to delays due to inefficient handling of medical records
The Solution
E Doc aims to solve these issues by providing a centralized digital solution that offers real-time access to personal health data, integrates lab results with visual diagnoses, and streamlines the insurance claim process, ultimately improving the speed and quality of care for patients.
